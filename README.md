# Oregon-Reportable-Diseases
This project analyzes data from Oregon from 2020 to 2026 January of reportable cases of medical conditions.
Using Ms Excel, I was able to clean and standardize the data, before loading it into MySQL for further analysis, after which, I loaded it into Power BI for visualizations.
Enjoy!
